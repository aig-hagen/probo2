# Solvers in Probo2

In order to add a solver to **Probo2** we need to specifiy three things:

- Name
- Version
- Full path to solver executable

The executable can be a compiled binary, bash script or a python file.  

As long as the executable implements the ICCMA interface it should work.
More information on the [ICCMA interface](http://argumentationcompetition.org/).
